## Lecture 2:
A perceptron can be used for Binary Classification while two classes are linearly seperable. A 2D visualization of perceptron is depicted below:

We know that a single perceptron is a linear function and can only do Binary Classification. We connect multiple perceptrons in multiple layers and apply non-linear activation function in between and improve the hypothesis class to learn better non-linear mappings. Such Neural Network is Called Feed Forward Neural Network and can learn more complex non-linear mapping. The learning procedure of an MLP which is utilized to regress a function is depicted below:
